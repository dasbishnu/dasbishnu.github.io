I love building products. I work as Senior Product Manager at one of the fastest growing edtech startups in India. I am responsible for the website product. My interests are varied and I mostly find myself musing in the intersection of technology and business.     

This website is built with Jekyll and Mediumish template for Jekyll. The entire site is created with Github Pages and hosted with Github. 

Here are a list of tools I use
- Visual Studio Code
- Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
- Google Tag Manager
- Hotjar
- Jekyll
- Github Pages
